# Bitburner-scripts
This repository is for tracking improvements with my scripts for the game bitburner. 

For more about bitburner, check out [the game's official repo here](<https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-src>
) or [their documentation site here.](<https://bitburner.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guidesandtips/gettingstartedguideforbeginnerprogrammers.html>
)

## History
Due to the design of the game, I started out with writing my scripts within the in-game code editor. However, after 60+ hours of game time (includes idle time from running scripts overnight) I began to miss having version control, which prompted me to begin migration of all of my scripts out of game. I am now using the [Bitburner Connector Extension for VSCode](<https://github.com/bitburner-official/bitburner-vscode>) to work in VSCode and sync the files to game.

## Plans
A lot of code gets re-used throughout multiple scripts. One of my plans is to start separating out these pieces into modules. This will also help prep for some overall re-writes I want to do to certain scripts in order to make them more efficient and reusable in different situations.
